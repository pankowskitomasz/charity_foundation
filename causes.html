                    HEALTHCARE AND CLEAN WATER
                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray">
                    A community without adequate healthcare cannot thrive. A community without 
                    a reliable source of clean water must spend its time on the basic necessities 
                    of survival and cannot spare the time or energy to send its children to school. 
                    Africa Foundation builds and upgrades clinics and accommodations for medical 
                    staff, facilitates HIV/AIDS awareness programs and other healthcare counseling 
                    and helps provide access to clean water.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray">
                    One of the worst daily hardships faced by many African rural communities is the 
                    extreme shortage of water. Rural women and children often walk more than a 
                    kilometer every day to fetch water, returning home stooped under the backbreaking 
                    burden of their full water buckets, sometimes repeating this trip several times 
                    per day. When children are required to spend a large part of their day gathering 
                    water, the task affects all aspects of their youth, especially time spent on 
                    education and physical development.

                    Africa Foundation works with communities on agricultural projects, provides 
                    entrepreneurial support and builds skills centers and markets in which community 
                    members can sell their products. Many of the staff members in andBeyond safari 
                    lodges come from local communities and are trained by andBeyond to work in all 
                    aspects of safari lodge operations.

                <p class="text-gray">
                    Effective skills training programs are essential to rural development and are 
                    a result of active community involvement and ownership of the process, along 
                    with access to appropriate resources for training. Africa Foundation sponsors 
                    groups of community members in intensive three-month training courses in 
                    Kwa-Zulu-Natal. The program teaches skills such as plumbing, carpentry, electrical 
                    knowledge, brick-laying, tiling, plastering and emerging contractor training. 
                    Students are selected through local authorities and include men and women of 
                    various ages. They arrive unemployed and semi-skilled, but leave with basic 
                    levels in all skills.

                <p class="text-gray">
                    Since its inception, Conservation Corporation Africa (now andBeyond) has trained 
                    members of local communities to work in all aspects of safari lodge operations. 
                    Community members are rangers, chefs, dining room staff and house keepers. In 
                    addition to providing valuable income to community members, these jobs strengthen 
                    the connections between the lodge and the community.

                <p class="text-gray">
                    The WILDLIFE AND ENVIRONMENT program aims to provide rural communities with the 
                    capacity for informed decision making about land management and conservation and 
                    also focuses on the conservation of wildlife.  Students learn about the neighboring 
                    game preserves through conservation lessons and visits to the preserves. The 
                    program also includes community training on subjects such as the effective use 
                    of water resources.  The recently created Rhinos Without Borders translocation 
                    project will provide essential protection to this endangered member of Africa’s 
                    “Big Five.”

                <p class="text-gray">
                    With rhino poaching at an all-time high in South Africa, Africa Foundation is 
                    supporting andBeyond and Great Plains Conservation in a project to safely 
                    translocate up to 100 rhinos from South Africa to the safe haven of Botswana, 
                    which has an excellent security system in place to protect these critically 
                    endangered animals and will be a safe haven for the relocated rhinos. To learn
